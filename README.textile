h1. Tinux

By "curzio.moriggia@sunrise.ch":mailto:curzio.moriggia@sunrise.ch. Tinux is a (very) small Linux distribution that was actually created to compile C source code and to allow minimal network checks. The first version is bootable from a CD and needs at least 128MB RAM memory. Feel free to contribute since a lot of packages and features are outstanding

h2. ISO unstable

Be warned that at this time the distribution is still unstable since a lot of dependencies are missing (additionally the planned (TCC) C compiler and linker is not yet setup and installed. This distribution will only load into RAM memory 

h2. Running on an emulator

Before burning the ISO on a CD it is strongly advised to try the distribution via "QEMU":http://homepage3.nifty.com/takeda-toshiya/ (a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer)
<pre>qemu -cdrom mintyboot.iso -m 128 -boot d</pre>
